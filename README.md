About this project
--------------
üöÄ Grid view List of pictures. 

üõ† Simple implementation for MVI architecture pattern and Clean Architecture.

üõ† Unit tests included with test coverage round 100% for repositories, UseCases and ViewModels.

üõ† SOLID principles.

üõ† Standard Coding Style.


The Business Details
--------------
- The application should have two screens:
  * The first screen have one view with thumbnails of all available photos returned from API.
  * When the user taps on one of the thumbnails, a second screen load to show the larger photo in the middle of the screen.
- Image Urls should be edited by omitting the proxy part ‚Äúm.mobile.de/yams-proxy/‚Äù, prepending ‚Äúhttps://‚Äù 
  and appending ‚Äú?rule=mo-640.jpg‚Äù for normal images or ‚Äú?rule=mo-1600.jpg‚Äù for larger one.
- Display a grid list with 2 columns in the portrait mode and 3 columns in the landscape mode.

Libraries & Tools Used
--------------

* [Foundation][0] - Components for core system capabilities, Kotlin extensions and support for
  multidex and unit testing.
* [Test][4] - An Android testing framework for unit and runtime UI tests.
* [Architecture][10] - A collection of libraries that help you design robust, testable, and
  maintainable apps. Start with classes for managing your UI component lifecycle and handling data
  persistence.
    * [View Binding][11] - To more easily write code that interacts with views. 
    * [Lifecycles][12] - Create a UI that automatically responds to lifecycle events.
    * [Navigation][14] - Handle everything needed for in-app navigation.
    * [ViewModel][17] - Store UI-related data that isn't destroyed on app rotations. Easily schedule
      asynchronous tasks for optimal execution.
    * [Repository][3] - A Module that handle data operations, You can consider repositories to be mediators between different data sources.
    * [Kotlin Flows][21] - A stream of data that can be computed asynchronously.
    * [Retrofit][20] - A simple library that is used for network transaction.
    * [Glide][90] For image loading.
    * [Hilt][92]: For [dependency injection][93]
    * [Kotlin Coroutines][91] For managing background threads with simplified code and reducing needs for callbacks.
* Other tools/plugins   
    * [Google material design][94] to build high-quality digital experiences for Android.
    * [SonarLint plugin][50] - Static Code Analysis that identifies and helps you fix quality and security issues as you code.

Technical choices
--------------

**MVI vs MVVM**

- A consistent state during the lifecycle of Views. 
- As it is unidirectional, Data flow can be tracked and predicted easily. 
- It ensures thread safety as the state objects are immutable.
- Easy to debug, As we know the state of the object when the error occurred.
- It's more decoupled as each component fulfills its own responsibility.
- Testing the app also will be easier as we can map the business logic for each state.

**RecyclerView vs listview**

- In RecyclerView, it is mandatory to use ViewHolder pattern Which optimize the performance.
- DiffUtil callback Which optimize the performance.

**Activities vs Fragments**

- I have used a single-activity architecture which allowed me to take full advantage of the Navigation component, which mean that a single activity that manages and host multiple fragments.
- The fragment is more lite weight than Activity.
- I also added simple animation in navigation between fragments.

**Hilt vs Dagger2 vs Koin**

- Hilt is built on top of the Dagger, and it comes with some advantages like simplify Dagger code and create a standard set of components and scopes to ease setup.
- As this project is simple, Hilt is the best one. For more complex projects I will go with Dagger2 to avoid some limitation of hilt.
- Hilt does not need factories for ViewModel, koin need.
- Hilt generate the code in the compile time, while koin in runtime.

**Coroutines vs RxJava**

- Coroutines come with many advantages over RxJava, beside that it is Kotlin-friendly design pattern, it is: 
	* Lightweight: You can run many coroutines on a single thread due to support for suspension.
    * Fewer memory leaks: Use structured concurrency to run operations within a scope.
    * Built-in cancellation support.
    * Many Jetpack libraries include extensions that provide full coroutines support.

**Retrofit vs Volley**

- Retrofit has a well-designed structure.
- Suspend function support.

**Moshi vs GSON**

- Moshi is a Kotlin-Friendly converter. 
- Moshi has better and more human-readable serialization failed messages.
- Moshi has Code-gen adapter for Kotlin, This is great! With help of annotations, you make the Serialization/Deserialization much faster and bypass the old slow reflection method that Gson uses!


**Glide**

- Glide very effective for almost any case where you need to fetch, resize, cache and display a remote image.
- Support thumbnail and placeholder which I needed in this project.


What's next
--------------
While the project scale up, Some points should be considered: 
- Parent classes for common classes like ViewModels and Use Cases.
- Analytics and tracking system should be implemented to provide insight on app usage and user engagement.
- Caching mechanism should be added to reduce network calls.
- Pagination.
