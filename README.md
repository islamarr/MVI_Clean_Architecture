Libraries & Tools Used
--------------

* [Foundation][0] - Components for core system capabilities, Kotlin extensions and support for
  multidex and automated testing.
* [Test][4] - An Android testing framework for unit and runtime UI tests.
* [Architecture][10] - A collection of libraries that help you design robust, testable, and
  maintainable apps. Start with classes for managing your UI component lifecycle and handling data
  persistence.
    * [Data Binding][11] - Declaratively bind observable data to UI elements.
    * [Lifecycles][12] - Create a UI that automatically responds to lifecycle events.
    * [Navigation][14] - Handle everything needed for in-app navigation.
    * [ViewModel][17] - Store UI-related data that isn't destroyed on app rotations. Easily schedule
      asynchronous tasks for optimal execution.
    * [Repository][3] - A Module that handle data operations, You can consider repositories to be mediators between different data sources.
    * [Kotlin Flows][21] - A stream of data that can be computed asynchronously.
    * [Retrofit][20] - A simple library that is used for network transaction.
    * [Glide][90] For image loading.
    * [Hilt][92]: For [dependency injection][93]
    * [Kotlin Coroutines][91] For managing background threads with simplified code and reducing needs for callbacks.
* Other tools/plugins   
    * [SonarLint plugin][50] - Static Code Analysis that identifies and helps you fix quality and security issues as you code.
